# Shoppies Application

## Demo

Please visit https://chris-shopify-frontend.herokuapp.com.
To run it locally, clone the repo, install the dependencies, then run 'npm start'.

## Features

1. Dynamic search with debouncing and error handling.
2. Links to IMDb website for each movie.
3. No clunky or unnecessary buttons - just click a movie poster to nominate it or remove it.

## Wanted to do

1. I had an entire server up and running with a DB but unfortunately ran into CORS issues. The consequent server integration in this repository is commented out. Server code can be found here: https://github.com/cchoi96/shopify-backend
2. Testing.
